# Caesar-Cipher
This program asks the user for a message they would like to  encode and the amount of shifts they would like to apply to the message.  After that the program uses the ASCII table as reference to shift the given message a set amount of times(provided by the user) and prints it in blocks of five letters, ten blocks per line. (Note: Punctuation Marks, Digits, and Blanks will be ignored)
